    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Philly Cheesesteak Dip would make a handsome addition to your snack table for the Big Game!</p>
    <p>Like all great party foods, it's wonderful hot, warm, room temperature, and, I've heard from a reliable source, even 'delicious cold.'</p>
    <p>Serve alongside sliced baguette. Keep it hot and fresh for guests by baking it in 2 batches, or feel free to do this all at once in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p> 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pepperoncini peppers</li>
        <li>7 pickled red peppers (such as Peppadew)</li>
        <li>3 jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 pound provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice steak into thick pieces. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Add steak slices and sear until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and reduce heat to medium. Cook until juices appear on the tops, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
        <li>Add diced onion, a big pinch of salt, and butter to the meat juices in the pan. Cook and stir over medium heat, scraping up the browned bits, until onions start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dice up the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, pepperoncini, pickled red peppers, and jalapenos until you have 1 1/2 to 2 cups. Add to the onions; cook and stir until starting to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Chop steak into small pieces. Place back into the bowl with the accumulated meat juices. Add the onion-pepper mixture and cream cheese. Grate in the provolone cheese, saving a little for the top. Drizzle in Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle in cayenne pepper. Mix dip thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Transfer 1/2 of the dip into a small baking dish. Smooth the top with a fork. Place the baking dish on top of a sheet pan. Sprinkle the remaining provolone cheese on top. Save the other 1/2 to bake fresh for your guests.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dip is bubbling and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Broil until top is browned, about 1 minute more. Repeat with the second batch of dip.</li>
    </ol>
