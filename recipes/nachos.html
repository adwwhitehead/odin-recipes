    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These steak nachos are one of my all-time favourite party foods.</p>
    <p>For big games or special events, these nachos should get serious consideration for formulating your snack line-up.</p>
    <p>I recommend serving this with hot sauce on the side, and lots of beer!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Steak:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) skirt steak or flap steak</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Beans:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon fat</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water or chicken broth, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nachos:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) bag corn tortilla chips</li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes, chopped, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped white onion, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream, for topping</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>To cook the steak:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak, turning occasionally, to medium doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steak to a bowl and let it rest.</li>
        <li>Pour a splash of water into the skillet; stir to scrape up browned bits and deglaze the pan. Pour this liquid over meat. Allow meat to cool completely.</li>
        <li>When meat is completely cool, slice thickly (about 1/2 inch) with the grain, then cut into thinner strips. Dice by cutting into pieces against the grain. Transfer chopped steak back to the bowl; toss with the pan drippings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To make the beans:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt bacon fat over medium heat in a pot. Add onion and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in oregano. Add pinto beans and water. Bring back to a simmer and cook until onions are soft, about 5 more minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Mash beans with a potato masher to your desired consistency. Add additional liquid if necessary to achieve your preferred texture. Add the remaining salt to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To assemble the nachos:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place tortilla chips about 2 or 3 deep in a heat-proof pan. (You may need more than one pan.) Top chips with spoonfuls of beans and a generous handful of steak pieces.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges start to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scatter tomato, avocado, onion, and jalapeño over the top. Drizzle nachos with sour cream and garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
